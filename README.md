# Navi Public Training Repo
First and foremost thank you for take a look. One of the major things lacking in the industry right now is reliable training data for cybersec AI. 
## The Imperative of Open Training Data for Cybersecurity AI
As the cyber threat landscape continues to evolve, the need for effective AI-powered cybersecurity solutions has never been more pressing. However, developing and training AI models that can accurately detect and respond to threats requires high-quality, diverse, and curated datasets.

This is where open training data comes in, a critical component for building trustworthy and reliable AI systems. By making our training data available to the public, we aim to:
- Accelerate innovation: Provide researchers, developers, and organizations with access to high-quality data, enabling them to focus on developing new AI-powered cybersecurity solutions.
- Improve collaboration: Foster a community-driven approach to AI development, where individuals and organizations can share knowledge, expertise, and resources to address the complexities of cybersecurity threats.
- Enhance transparency: Promote open and transparent practices in AI development, ensuring that models are trained on diverse data sets and are more likely to be robust and reliable.
